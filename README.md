# FIRE-FIGHTING-ROBOT
i developed a fire- fighting robot .which is autonomously detect the fire and move forward towards the fire and spray the water 
# 🔥 Arduino-Based Fire Fighting Robot 🤖  

## 📖 Project Overview  
The **Fire Fighting Robot** is an autonomous system designed to detect and extinguish fire sources using **Arduino Uno**, **IR sensors**, **DC motors**, and a **water spraying mechanism**.  

Once a fire is detected, the robot navigates towards the source, positions its nozzle, and activates the water pump to extinguish the fire.  

This project was developed as part of my **final year engineering thesis** under the guidance of **Ms. J. Beena Sindhuri (Assistant Professor, Dept. of ECE, AITS Kadapa).**

## 🧩 Working Principle  
1. IR sensors continuously scan the environment.  
2. When fire is detected, the robot automatically moves towards the source.  
3. The servo motor aligns the nozzle with the fire.  
4. The water pump activates to extinguish the fire.
